I consider myself an interested man. Topics covered encompass (but are not restricted to) business, economics, philosophy, sociology, and history.

This blog studies cosmology: the problem of understanding the world -- including ourselves, and our knowledge, as part of the world.

My goal is to remain anonymous (to whatever extent is possible) and to document my discoveries for the purpose of an undisclosed, future project.
