I consider myself an interested man. Topics covered encompass (but are not restricted to) any intersection between business, economics, philosophy, sociology, and history.

My goal is to remain anonymous (to whatever extent is possible) and to document my discoveries for the purpose of an undisclosed, future project.

Finally, I have no idea what I'm doing with this blog, so ignore the disorganization and randomness...
