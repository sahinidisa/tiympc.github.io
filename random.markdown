# Links Of The Day
The more we learn and expand our knowledge, the more we become aware of the vastness of what we still don't know. Hopefully this page serves two purposes: 1) a reminder that there is so much out there to learn and 2) a gift of random links you can enjoy to learn more about our universe's secrets.

# Becoming A Gentleman
I would like to share a draft of my book on men's formalwear and fragrances that you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HNobxdTDTnQTJD6i4KuU8MTcjP6wJc2v_EbRnGWsj7g/edit). I spent a considerable amount of time studying what makes a great dress shirt and how fragrances work. You'll find a plethora amount of knowledge on collars, cuffs, cufflinks, textile theory, patterns, and color theory for shirts, and much more about fragrances in here. 

As mentioned, this is a draft, and I plan on publishing a final version into a full-fledged book in the next few years. The goal of the book is to expand beyond shirts and fragrances and, ultimately, discuss what it means to be a gentleman (starting off with how to look like one). I have a list of topics outlined in the beginning of the document of which I will explore in the future.

Some fun facts in case you don't want to go through a 50 page word document...
1. A striped dress shirt will fit well in almost every workplace in the world. It conveys a sense of business, and the thinner the stripe usually the more formal the shirt. That's why the Yankees have stripes on their jerseys! They want the other teams to know they mean business.
2. Everyone knows that different colors symbolize different meanings. But, keep in mind that different audiences may perceive colors differently. For instance, while red typically symbolizes passion or power in the United States, it’s considered a color of mourning in South Africa!
3. There is a fragrance wheel that you can apply the same schemes with as the color wheel if you would like to create your own cologone (complementary, split complementary, analogous, triadic, and tetradic all apply to fragrances).
4. There's a reason why most fragrance experts recommend you to wait after spraying on your wrist before buying a cologone at the store. Fragrances are made up of top notes, middle notes, and base notes. The top notes are the scents that are apparent immediatelly after spraying the fragrance (they only last for around 15 mintues to 30 minutes). While the top notes create the first impression, the middle notes should be pleasant because they will influence the base notes to come, and the base notes will create the final, lasting impression. Using eau de parfum's as an example, base notes will linger for up to 8 hours. In other words, they're important!
5. Everybody’s body and environment are different. Your skin might be oily or dry, you might drink a lot or little water, you might live a sedentary lifestyle, you might eat healthy food, you might take certain medications, you might live in a unique climate, you might be old or young, or the pH of your skin might be preferred for a certain fragrance. These are some of the most important factors when it comes to how your body reacts to fragrances. One fragrance on your friend might smell entirely differently on you!
