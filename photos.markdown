![San Francisco, California (Baker Beach)](/images/baker-beach-bridge.jpg)
- 📍 San Francisco, California (Baker Beach)
- **Date**: Thursday, May 18, 2023
- **Description**: On the day before my 23rd birthday, I drove up to San Francisco, walked into a coffee shop and spent an hour handwriting a short story about a medieval kingdom, walked around the city camera in hand, sat in the San Francisco Public Library scouring through international books written in languages I could not understand... Sometimes you need to let your creativity out and have it do its thing. Oh, and I captured this absolute beauty of a photograph just hours later.

![New York, New York (Times Square)](/images/times-square-amc.jpg)
- 📍 New York, New York (Times Square)
- **Date**: Fri July 9, 2021

- 📍 New York, New York (Garment District)
- **Date**: Fri July 9, 2021
- **Description**: A little more grim than my current taste. However, my photography started off as dark, so it makes sense that I was attracted to this scene.


![Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh Junction Railroad)](/images/railroad.jpg)
- 📍Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh Junction Railroad)
- **Date**: Sat March 20, 2021
- **Description**: After walking miles down a railroad behind my college campus, I randomly came across this graphic. Not the most comforting message to see at sundown while miles away from campus with no way back but to follow a railroad! 😭
