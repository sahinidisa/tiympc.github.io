- *Mouth to Mouth* by Antoine Wilson
    - "Sly, suspensful, and engrossing, *Mouth to Mouth* masterfully blurs the line between opportunity and exploitation, self-resepect and self-delusion, fact and fiction -- exposing the myriad ways we decieve one another, and ourselves."
    - One of Barack Obama's Favorite Books of 2022
    - Favorite Quote
        - “There is no more powerful skill for success in any field than knowing how to ask the right questions. A painter, for example, might be working on a body of work, asking, “Is it beautiful? Is it beautiful?” and that might be, unbeknownst to him, the wrong question. He might go completely astray in search of a quality that has nothing at all to do with where the work should be going.”

- *Dinosaurs* by Lydia Millet
    - "Millet explores the uncanny terrirtory where he self ends and community begins -- what one person can do in a world beset by emergencies. In the sadow of exisetntial threat, where does hope live?"
