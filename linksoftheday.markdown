*"Our knowledge can only be finite, while our ignorance must necessarily be infinite."* - Karl Popper

The more we learn and expand our knowledge, the more we become aware of the vastness of what we still don't know. Hopefully this page serves two purposes: 1) a reminder that there is so much out there to learn and 2) a gift of random links you can enjoy to learn more about our universe's secrets.

Additionally, I would like to share a draft of my book on men's formalwear and fragrances that you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HNobxdTDTnQTJD6i4KuU8MTcjP6wJc2v_EbRnGWsj7g/edit). I spent a considerable amount of time studying what makes a great dress shirt and how fragrances work. You'll find a plethora amount of knowledge on collars, cuffs, cufflinks, textile theory, and color theory for shirts, and much more about fragrances in here (believe it or not, but just like there's a color wheel, there's a fragrance wheel, as well!). 

I figured I would share this knowledge above to whoever lands on this blog. As mentioned, this is a draft. The goal of the book is to expand beyond shirts and fragrances and ultimately discuss what it means to look like a gentleman. I have a list of topics outlined in the beginning of the document of which I will explore in the future. In the meantime, enjoy!
