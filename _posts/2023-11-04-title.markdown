Philotimo. Although translated into "friend of honor," its meaning encompasses much more. To a Greek, this word describes passion, virtue, selflessness, ambition, philanthropy, drive, kindness, duty, and doing the right thing when no one is watching. Philotimo is not just a word, it is a way of living. Philotimo is owning your family's name everywhere you go.
