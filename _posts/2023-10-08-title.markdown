![The Greek Genocide](/images/greek-genocide.jpeg)
Growing up in the United States as a Greek-American was an indescribable experience, but I'll do my best to describe it. First of all, I never felt American. Despite being one of the 94% of white students in my school district, I always felt like the minority. Greek culture, let alone European culture, is vastly different than any culture I have experienced. Therefore, I did not relate with the other students, and the culture at home was not one I felt comfortable explaining and revealing to my peers.

When I matriculated at my private university, I was surrounded by all sorts of international cultures. For the first time in my life, I didn't feel like a minority. During my studies, my very best friends were Chinese, Indian, Korean, and Latinos. Although I hardly met a fellow Greek, I was soothed by the multicultural environment at my university enough to forget who I was.

Shortly after graduating, however, I experienced certain events in my life that forced me to look inwards. As a result, I began to question who I was, and instinctively I went to my mother and father and questioned who *they* were. Where are my ancestors from? Why do I speak Greek? Who *were* the Greeks? Despite feeling self-conscious about revealing my Greek culture when I was young, I didn't know anything about it in the first place (at least relative to how much I know today).

Today's blog covers the Greek Genocide through the perspective of my father supplemented by historical facts. Recently, I began studying the Greek Genocide, particularly because my father's family -- hence mine -- was severely impacted by this sad event in history. 

I'd like to provide a short backstory of the Greek-Turkish relations. Historically, this relationship is complex and has experienced periods of both cooperation and tension. The two countries share a long history, geographical proximity, and cultural connections, but the relationship has been marked by disputes over issues such as territorial claims and ethnic and religious differences.

The Greek Genocide, also known as the Greek Holocaust or the Pontic Greek Genocide, was part of the wider pattern of ethnic cleansing and mass extermination that occurred during the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The genocide primarily targeted the indigenous Greek population of the Ottoman Empire and other Christian minority groups, such as the Armenians and Assyrians. My Armenian friend and I still talk about it to this day. Estimates of the death toll vary, with figures ranging from 289,000 to 750,000 Greeks killed between 1914 and 1923 (keep in mind that the population of Greece is around 10 million as of 2023).

My mother's family hailed from the Peloponnese Region (southern Greece) so I like to call them the original Greeks (think Sparta, Kalamata, Patras, Corinth, Tripoli, and so on). My father's family, however, is Pontic. Pontic means 'denoting or relating to the Black Sea.' Therefore, These Greeks occupied the northeastern region of Anatolia (present-day Turkey). Consequently, my paternal grandmother's family originates from the Turkish city Trabzon, while my paternal grandfather's family comes from a bit further east. At times, they lived around the Caucasus mountains shown on the map below. My great grandfather was an officer in the army of the last emperor of Russia, Czar Nicholas II, before they moved further west.

During World War I, the Greek Genocide occured as part of a wider pattern of ethnic cleansing and mass extermination of minority populations within the collapsing Ottoman Empire. The genocide of Greeks, along with the Armenians and Assyrians, can be attributed to several interconnected factors: Ethnic and religious tensions, nationalism and Turkification, and World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

Now, the genocide was performed by the government of the Ottoman Empire, led by the Three Pashas, and by the Government of the Grand National Assembly led by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, against the indigenous Greek population of the Empire. The genocide included massacres, rape, forced deportations, death marches, expulsions, summary executions, and the destruction of Eastern Orthodox cultural, historical, and religious monuments. Several hundred thousand Greeks died during this period, and most of the survivors fled to Greece (including my family), adding over a quarter to the prior population of Greece. One of my relatives gave birth while on the death of march. For those unfamiliar, the death of march is a forced march of prisoners of war or other captives or deportees in which individuals are left to die along the way. 

During the summer of 1914, the secret police, assisted by the government and army officials, conscripted Greek men of military age into Labour Battalions, in which hundreds of thousands of Greek men died due to ill-treatment and thorough outright massacre by the Ottoman guards.

The genocide culminated in the Great Fire of Smyrna in 1922, where thousands of Greeks and Armenians were killed, and many more were expelled. The genocide had a lasting impact, leading to the near-complete ending of the Greek ethnic presence in Turkey and the expulsion of Turks from Greece. The genocide remains a highly sensitive and contentious issue, with recognition from various countries and organizations. However, this recognition is not as widespread as most would think. In the case of the Greek genocide, not all countries officially recognize it as such.

When I was a young boy, my mother always shared tales of the great Kolokotronis, a prominent leader of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. Us Greeks are proud people, and Kolokotronis has been our symbol of perserverance. The Greek history is not just rich from thousands of years ago in the days of Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, and the other phenomenal Ancient Greek figures. There are certain events in recent times that also require attention and recognition, the Greek Genocide being one.

The Pontics are a special form of Greeks. In [the closing ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJbzez0uJIM) of the 2004 Olympics hosted in Athens, the traditional Pontic war dance, Serra (also called Pyrrhichios), was performed as millions were watching. This dance was mentioned in the Illiad by Homer (and others). It was the favorite dance of the Spartans and is also associated with the infant life of Zeus in myths. Pontians revived the dance in Greece after their persecution. I am proud to be a Pontic's son.

Oh, and my birthday is the official remembrance day of the Pontic Greek Genocide...so that's awesome. Although I am not an expert on Greek history, I am excited to dive deeper into this wealth of knowledge. Perhaps, this is a silver lining of the aftermath of the Greek Genocide.
