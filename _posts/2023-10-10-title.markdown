Last night, I think I saw my guardian angel in a parking lot.

I remember seeing him and feeling anxious in the moment. He had gray hair and was wearing a gray tunic and gray pants. His face hardly looked human but it is still very vivid in my mind. He opened the trunk of a very old, gray car next to mine and put some items in a gray wagon before leaving the scene. It felt like he came out of nowhere. I was recording my drive at the time and, when I looked back at my footage, he was no longer there.

About an hour later, I was driving back at night in the woods, and my car hydroplaned for around 8 seconds. I felt my wheels on the left side of my car leave the ground, and I drifted until I regained control. At some point, I felt like I was going to tumble sideways onto the trees. Immediately after I gained control, a car on the opposite lane went past me and I managed not to collide. This is the closest experience I’ve had with death, and I can’t stop thinking about the man in gray. Seeing him did not feel normal, and for the circumstances, I don’t know how I survived.
