Last night, I think I saw my guardian angel in a parking lot.

I had just driven for an hour to Bodega Bay by myself after a stressful day. I like to drive while reflecting on my thoughts, and I was in a contemplative state of mind the entire night.

I parked in a lot next to a gray car, and then I distinctly remember seeing a man and feeling anxious in that moment. He had gray hair and was wearing a gray tunic and gray pants. His face hardly looked real, yet it remains vivid in my mind: old yet strong. He opened the trunk of the gray car next to mine, grabbed a bag, and just as it felt as though he came out of nowhere, he was gone. I was recording my drive at the time. When I reviewed the footage of pulling into the parking lot, he was gone from it.

About an hour later, I was driving back at night through the woods. Suddenly, my car hydroplaned for around 8 seconds as I was turning a corner on a windy road. I felt my wheels on the left side of my car leave the ground, and I thought I was going to tumble sideways into the trees. At some point, I regained control and managed to avoid a collision with an oncoming car.

I don't know how I survived, and I can't stop thinking about the man in gray. His appearance and the circumstances are highly unsettling and unusual. Last night, I think I saw my guardian angel in a parking lot.
