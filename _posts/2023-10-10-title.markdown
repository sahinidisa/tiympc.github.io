Last night, I think I saw my guardian angel in a parking lot.

I had just drove an hour to Bodega Bay by myself. I parked in a parking lot next to a gray car, and then I remember seeing him and feeling anxious in the moment. He had gray hair and was wearing a gray tunic and gray pants. His face hardly looked real but it is still very vivid in my mind: old but strong. It felt like he came out of nowhere and suddenly he was gone. I was recording my drive at the time. When I looked back at my footage of pulling into the parking lot, he was no longer there.

About an hour later, I was driving back at night in the woods. Suddenly, my car hydroplaned for around 8 seconds. I felt my wheels on the left side of my car leave the ground, and I thought I was going to tumble sideways onto the trees. At some point, I gained control and managed to avoid a collision with an oncoming car.

I can't stop thinking about the man in gray. His appearance and the circumstances are highly unsettling and unusual. I don't know how I survived.
