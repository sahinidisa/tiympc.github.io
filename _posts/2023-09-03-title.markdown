üìç Los Angeles, CA

Interstate 5 left me speechless (despite driving alone and not needing to use my voice). With mountains like gold and sunsets like neopolitan ice cream, I was left wondering when I would be able to make this drive again. California is a special part of this world. I am lucky to be a part of it.

Currently, I am writing from Motoring Coffee in Los Angeles. It is rare to find somewhere to sit down and sip an espresso, while just feet away from a Ferrari 348 Challenge and a dozen other vehicles from The Stonge Age (not literally but you get the idea). There is something special about combining two seemingly unconnected worlds, like coffee and cars: If anyone ever needs an idea for a brick-and-mortar business, consider a museum-themed coffee shop.

But to jump back on subject, I must've seen around a couple hundred 18-wheelers during my seven-hour drive to Los Angeles last night. Everything labeled as 'Made in China' has most likely made its way through California at some point in time. The amount of trucks driving through Interstate 5 should serve as a stark reminder of just how large the economy of California is. As of today, California boasts the 5th largest GDP in the world.

As a young man from Pittsburgh, it's difficult to comprehend what contributes to California's prosperity. Each day, I walk through the streets of San Francisco, and I am faced with the harsh realities of today's world. There is no feeling more sad than seeing countless homeless individuals, who are sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, and friends. Homelessness and Pittsburgh is oxymoronic, or maybe I am privilieged to be able to say that as I grew up in the hills of Mount Lebanon, a quaint, community-centric township in Pittsburgh that is known for its "bubble."

If you are reading this, remember to be kind to those on the streets. I understand that is tempting to be angry, disgusted, and spiteful towards this population, but do acknowledge that we all have made poor choices in our lives or been dealt a bad hand at some point. If you're going to throw away that slice of pizza that you weren't able to finish, consider passing it off to someone who might need it. 

We all have a moral obligation to help and pick up the (wo)man next to us. It doesn't matter if you're a Christian, a Muslim, an atheist, an agnostic, or if you believe in butterflies. We're all human beings. We've all ridden a bicycle for the first time. We've all laughed and cried. We've all once fallen in love. We've all felt shame and grief. And we've all chased ambition and aspiration. You, me, and the person sleeping on the street. If you are a San Francisco local, consider volunteering [here](https://www.sfmfoodbank.org/volunteer/) if you would like to give back to your community.

To finally conclude this monologue, there is beauty in the world around you as long as you look for it and even if it doesn't make sense (e.g., coffee and cars). Remember that we all have a moral obligation to love those around us, regardless of where we come from. Paying it forward is one of the most gratifying feelings in the world. And, if you are in search of an adventure, take the drive through Interstate 5 - you won't be sorry.
