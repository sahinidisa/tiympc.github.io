üìç Los Angeles, CA

Every experience in life offers an oportunity to learn about the world around us and to be a better human being. Adventures are especially prone to this.

Interstate 5 left me speechless, despite driving alone and not needing to use my voice. With mountains like gold and a sunset like neapolitan ice cream, I was left wondering when I would be able to make this drive again. California is a special part of this world. I am lucky to be a part of this state.

Currently, I am writing from Motoring Coffee in Los Angeles. It is rare to find somewhere to sit down and sip an espresso, while just feet away from a Ferrari 348 Challenge and a dozen other rare vehicles. There is something special about combining two seemingly unconnected worlds, like coffee and cars: If anyone ever needs an idea for a brick-and-mortar business, consider a museum-themed coffee shop.

On my way to Los Angeles, I must have seen around 200 18-wheelers during my seven-hour drive last night. My younger sister, who I had on the phone for the last hour of my drive, made a phenomenal point: Most goods labeled as 'Made in China' have most likely stopped at California at some point in time. As of today, California boasts the 5th largest GDP in the world, proving just how monumental this state is for the American economy.

As a young man from Pittsburgh, it's difficult to comprehend what contributes to California's prosperity. Each day, I walk through the streets of San Francisco, and I am faced with the harsh realities of today's inequalities. There is no feeling more sad than seeing countless individuals, sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, and friends living on the streets of San Francisco. Homelessness and Pittsburgh is oxymoronic, or maybe I am privileged to be able to say that as I grew up in the quaint hills of Mount Lebanon, community-centric township in Pittsburgh that is known for its "bubble." That said, I had never seen a homeless person until my 21st year on this earth, when I spent a summer in Manhattan.

It might be tempting to be angry, disgusted, or spiteful towards the homeless population. I have close friends who feel this way. However, I hope we can all acknowledge that sometimes we make poor choices in life. Other times, we've simply been dealt a bad hand. Remember to be kind to those on the streets. In other words, if you're going to throw away that slice of pizza that you weren't able to finish, consider passing it off to someone who might need it.

We all have a moral obligation to try to help and pick up the man or woman next to us. It doesn't matter if you're a Christian, a Muslim, an atheist, an agnostic, or if you believe in butterflies. We're all human beings. We've all once fallen in love. We've all ridden a bicycle for the first time. We've all felt shame and grief. We've all laughed and cried. And we've all chased ambition and aspiration. We're human. You, me, and the person sleeping on the street. If you are a San Francisco local, consider volunteering [here](https://www.sfmfoodbank.org/volunteer/) if you would like to give back to your community.

I would like to close on a few final thoughts:
1. There is beauty in the world around you as long as you look for it, even if it doesn't make sense (e.g., coffee and cars). Obviously this is self-explanatory, but the hard part is looking for it. Once you make the effort to seek beauty, you'll find it.
2. You have a moral obligation to love those around you, regardless of where you've come from or what you believe. Love is a complicated concept. I am still unsure about its meaning, but I've learned that sometimes you have to think less and feel more. You'll know when you're doing it right.
3. And, if you are in search of an adventure, take the drive through Interstate 5 - you won't be sorry.

As always: TIYMPC,
