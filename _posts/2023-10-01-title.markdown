This post takes this blog in a completely different direction. Enjoy the randomness, but I am not sure I'll keep this here for much longer; this post is extremely personal and shouldn't really be on the internet...

Between 2016 and 2020, I gained around 40 pounds of clean muscle through a consistent exercise schedule. As a varsity sport athlete, I took what I learned in high school and built off of my momentum by maintaing an athletic physique in college. When COVID happened, I was in the best shape of my life. I was a fighting machine, bench pressing 175 and squatting 225 on normal sets, far above the normal numbers for someone of my size.

But a negligence towards the gym, a dependance on stimulants like caffeine, an entire year of illness putting me in bed for 80 days of 2022 (literally 80 days), and a surgery to fix said illness doesn't bode well for anyone's physical health.

But, it doesn't matter how badly we fall. It's about how badly we're willing to get back up.

I am feeling motivated to win back that feeling of accomplishment when you know you're the baddest motherfucker in that gym. For me, this is an intrinsic motivation that nobody can take away from me. I tend to have an animalistic obsession about certain things that I would never want any of my competitors to have. It's a gift and a curse, but right now it feels like Christmas, because I haven't felt this way about the gym in years.

I know that I am about to do something great, and I am excited more about the journey than the destination. God gave me a vehicle called a body, and though I couldn't have asked for a sportier model üòé, it's time I walk the walk and talk the talk.

I am at the stage of my life where I am genuinely feeling confident in my abilities and mindset. Afterall, I have come to the conclusion that confidence *is* a mindset. It took me my entire life to discover this, but these past several months *especially*, I've adopted a certain mindset that I think is undestructible. I feel unstoppable: My Greek ancestors are going to watch me become the greatest man in my entire bloodline.

I am starting to feel like a man, and not for reasons most would think: My brothers and sisters depend on me to lead them, despite being the second youngest of five. It is a great burden but also a great responsibility; one I am willing to take for the sake of love. There is a sense of purpose and reassurance associated with being who those close around you depend on. I am not quite certain of what I'm about to say, but I believe that my father is mentoring me for this role in preparation for the day that he leaves this earth. It's a grim thought to have, but one we must prepare for due to the nature of inevitability.

As my journey of manhood truly begins, I can be one of two people. The first sits around on October 31st making excuses as to why they didn't work towards their goal. Or, I can be the second person, who hit the gym 12 times, started eating seriously, and says to himself: "I gained four pounds this month, let me do four fucking more in November."
