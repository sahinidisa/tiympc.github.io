This post takes this blog in a completely different direction. Enjoy the randomness...

Between 2016 and 2020, I gained around 40 lbs of clean muscle through a consistent exercise schedule. As a varsity sport athlete, I took what I learned in high school and built off of my momentum by maintaing an athletic physique in college. I was in the best shape of my life when COVID happened. I was a fighting machine, bench pressing 175 and squatting 225 on normal sets, far above the normal numbers for someone weighing in at 140 lbs at 5' 6".

While some gained considerable weight as a result of COVID, I was the total opposite. A nengligence towards the gym, a dependance on stimulants like caffeine, an entire year of illness that put me in bed for 80 days of 2022, and a surgery to fix said illness doesn't bode well for your physical health. But, it doesn't matter how bad we fall. It's about how badly we're willing to get back up. And I'm willing to get back up and then some.

As of October 1st, 2023, I am weighing in at 123 lbs with a height of 5' 8". I am feeling motivated to change how I look and win back that feeling of accomplishment when you know you're the baddest motherfucker in that gym. For me, this is an intrinsic motivation that nobody can take away from me. I have an animalistic obsession about certain things that I would never want any of my competitors to have. It's been years since I've felt this way about the gym, and now I'm excited because I know that I am about to do something great.

God gave me a vehicle called a body, and though I couldn't have asked for a sportier model üòé, it's time I put my physical health above all else. That said, my goal is to weigh in at 150 lbs by my 24th birthday, approximately 7 months away. My plan is to lift 4 times a week and to eat, on average, 2800 calories a day. 

I am at the stage of my life where I am starting to feel confident in my abilities and mindset. Therefore, I know not to just set a goal for 7 months away and call it a day. What works for me is to break my long-term goals into smaller chunks. That said, I am taking this journey one month at a time, if not one week at a time. I am focusing on a simple diet consisting of milk, eggs, bananas, peanut butter sandwiches, chicken, rice, and protein shakes (excluding my lunches).

I can be one of two people. The first sits around on October 31st, not even putting a dent in their couch with that 123 lb body. Or, I can be the second person, who hit the gym 12 times, started eating seriously, and can say to himself: "I gained 4 lbs this month, let me do 4 fucking more in November." In what world is it okay to be happy picking the first person?! I'll have person number two, please.
