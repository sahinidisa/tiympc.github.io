### Mouth to Mouth by Antoine Wilson

![Mouth to Mouth](/_site/assets/images/mouth-to-mouth.jpg)

"Sly, suspensful, and engrossing, *Mouth to Mouth* masterfully blurs the line between opportunity and exploitation, self-resepect and self-delusion, fact and fiction -- exposing the myriad ways we decieve one another, and ourselves."

**Favorite Quote**:
“There is no more powerful skill for success in any field than knowing how to ask the right questions. A painter, for example, might be working on a body of work, asking, “Is it beautiful? Is it beautiful?” and that might be, unbeknownst to him, the wrong question. He might go completely astray in search of a quality that has nothing at all to do with where the work should be going.”

"Millet explores the uncanny terrirtory where he self ends and community begins -- what one person can do in a world beset by emergencies. In the sadow of exisetntial threat, where does hope live?"
