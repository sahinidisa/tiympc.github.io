### My Top Books Every Man Should Read

1. [Mouth to Mouth](https://www.amazon.com/Mouth-Novel-Antoine-Wilson/dp/1982181818/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) by Antoine Wilson
    - **Genre**: Thriller, Suspense, Psychological Fiction
    - **Description**: "Sly, suspensful, and engrossing, *Mouth to Mouth* masterfully blurs the line between opportunity and exploitation, self-respect and self-delusion, fact and fiction -- exposing the myriad ways we decieve one another, and ourselves."
    - **Favorite Quote**: “There is no more powerful skill for success in any field than knowing how to ask the right questions. A painter, for example, might be working on a body of work, asking, “Is it beautiful? Is it beautiful?” and that might be, unbeknownst to him, the wrong question. He might go completely astray in search of a quality that has nothing at all to do with where the work should be going.”
    - **Why You Should Read**: One of Barack Obama's favorite books of 2022.
2. [Dinosaurs](https://www.amazon.com/Dinosaurs-Novel-Lydia-Millet/dp/1324021462/ref=sr_1_1?crid=JSB8U15U36M6&keywords=dinosaurs+by+lydia+millet&qid=1696366442&s=books&sprefix=dinosaurs+by+lyd%2Cstripbooks%2C146&sr=1-1) by Lydia Millet
    - **Genre**: Satire, Psychological Fiction, Nature Writing
    - **Description**: "Millet explores the uncanny territory where the self ends and community begins -- what one person can do in a world beset by emergencies. *Dinosaurs* is both sharp-edged and tender, an emotionally moving, intellectually resonant novel that asks: In the shadow of existential threat, where does hope live?"
    - **Why You Should Read**: One of *Time*'s 100 must-read books of 2022.
3. [The Giver](https://www.amazon.com/Giver-Quartet-Lois-Lowry/dp/0544336267/ref=asc_df_0544336267/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312132071225&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3253094025934791113&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031944&hvtargid=pla-448095042674&psc=1) by Lois Lowry
    - **Genre**: Dystopian Fiction, Utopian Fiction, Science Fiction
    - **Description**: "Told with deceptive simplicity, this is the provocative story of a boy who experiences something incredible and undertakes something impossible. In the telling it questions every value we have taken for granted and reexamines our most deeply held beliefs."
    - **Why You Should Read**: Winner of the 1994 Newbery Medal, awarded annualy for the most distinguished contribution to juvenile literature. I'm sure you've already read this in gradeschool, but rereading it in your 20s is something else.
