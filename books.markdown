### My Top 25 Books Every Man Should Read

1. Mouth to Mouth by Antoine Wilson
    - **Genre**: Thriller, Suspense, Psychological Fiction
    - **Description**: "Sly, suspensful, and engrossing, *Mouth to Mouth* masterfully blurs the line between opportunity and exploitation, self-respect and self-delusion, fact and fiction -- exposing the myriad ways we decieve one another, and ourselves."
    - **Favorite Quote**: “There is no more powerful skill for success in any field than knowing how to ask the right questions. A painter, for example, might be working on a body of work, asking, “Is it beautiful? Is it beautiful?” and that might be, unbeknownst to him, the wrong question. He might go completely astray in search of a quality that has nothing at all to do with where the work should be going.”

### Dinosaurs by Lydia Millet

**Genre**: Satire, Psychological Fiction, Nature Writing

"Millet explores the uncanny territory where the self ends and community begins - what one person can do in a world beset by emergencies. Dinosaurs is both sharp-edged and tender, an emotionally moving, intellectually resonant novel that asks: In the shadow of existential threat, where does hope live?"
