    <p>üìç San Francisco, CA</p>

<p>Interstate 5 is a cathartic drive for those looking to escape the typical Californian scenery. Highway 1, on the other hand, is what a non-Californian native would expect when imagining the typical drive through California and, therefore, cannot be avoided in your California intrastate roadtrip plans.</p>

<p>I would recommend trying Highway 1 at least once, but if you are anything like me, Interstate 5 is the way to go. While Highway 1 has tremendous views, Interstate 5 is a subtler experience. You are better able to focus on the drive itself and to think about whatever thoughts are on your mind. It is less entertaining but more prone to reflection, something I like to do while driving.</p>

<p>With Highway 1, however, you are given the option of stopping at small towns that offer a certain quaintness that is unmatched in Los Angeles or the San Francisco Bay Area. Personally, I did Topang, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Solvang, and Morro Bay. Of these, I would highly recommend Topang and Solvang.</p>

<p>Driving from Los Angeles to Topang in the early hours of a Sunday morning felt isolating, enchanting, and rugged all at the same time. In order to arrive at Topanga, I had to exit through CA Highway 27, a misty, rocky, and winding road that led up to the small town with less than 10,000 inhabitants. I stopped for some coffee and breakfast, and admittedly watched football for two hours while working on this <em>tiympc</em> blog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/topanga-living-cafe.jpg" alt="Topanga Living Cafe" /></p>

<p>When I was about 30 minutes from Solvang, a Danish-style town tucked away between the Santa Ynez and San Rafael mountains, I spontaneously stopped at Cachuma Lake Vista Point. I had no idea of my location at the time but impulsively paused my roadtrip plans by parking my car on this beautiful cliff.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cachuma.jpg" alt="Cachuma Lake Vista Point" /></p>

<p>I knew that I needed to take in this view, and to share it with my father, who I FaceTimed immediately after I parked. He said that we will visit this spot together some day, and I really hope we do. He had a gigantic smile on his face. Although my father and I had trouble being honest about our feelings with each other when I was younger, I could tell that he was happy for me. I have never told him, but he is the man I aspire to be. If I can only have a fraction of his character, I know that my future children will be great people. I look forward to sharing all these specific thoughts the very next time I visit him. Without further adieu, I will definitely be back at this vista point, and I will definitely bring my father here.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Solvang, I decided to use my camera to find anything worth photographing. I like studying different architecture and knew this Danish-style town was the place to go if I wanted to see something different than I‚Äôm used to in California. But, after a few minutes of walking through the towncenter, I abandoned my goal of a Solvang photoshoot. Instead, I decided to take it all in and to live in the moment, something I have recently gotten better at.</p>

<p>After about 10 minutes of leaving town and resuming my roadtrip back to San Francisco, I had an interesting experience that I‚Äôd like to illustrate before wrapping up:</p>

<p><em>I‚Äôm driving along a peaceful road. Symmetrical rows of tall, majestic western sycamore trees stand sentinel on either side. Their lush green leaves form a dense canopy overhead, filtering out the soft afternoon sunlight coming from the west into dappled patterns hitting my face and the road ahead.</em></p>

<p><em>I am still driving at this point, so I don‚Äôt have too much time to observe my surroundings. However, I glance to my left and am immediatelly in awe of what I saw. My memory will never forget this image. Standing 20 meters perpendicular from my moving car was a gathering of chestnut horses, their heads bowed, delicately picking the wet, swampy grass underneath them.</em></p>

<p><em>A black fence stood in the way between the horses and the road. Past the horses were the mountains of Santa Ynez, with a slight misty fog present. Sometimes - and I‚Äôm certain you‚Äôve seen this happen before - angled sunlight hits the earth in such a way that the air around us comes alive and has a slight golden tinge to it, creating a magical atmosphere. Tiny, glistering particles, albeit invisible in the shadows, become revealed by the sun‚Äôs touch and seem to materialize in the sunlight.</em></p>

<p><em>For a split second, I was convinved to pull off to the side of the road, cross the road camera in hand, and photograph this majestic scene. But I didn‚Äôt. I kept driving. And 20 minutes later, still with regret looming in my mind, I thought about turning back. I never did. A week after returning back to San Francisco, I still think about what a photo of this scene would look like. What could have been‚Ä¶ But, we mustn‚Äôt linger on these feelings forever.</em></p>

<p><em>We have to learn to let go and take advantage of the next great opportunity we‚Äôre given. I believe that a well-lived life consists of one where great opportunities are acted upon, whether in the context of business, love, friendship, community serivce, or whatever is important to you.</em></p>

<p>As Always, TIYMPC (do you know what this means yet?)</p>
